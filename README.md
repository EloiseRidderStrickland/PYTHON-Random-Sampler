# Python Random Sampler
An Experimental Development Project.

### Use Case
The following program is a **Sequence Recognition Game** developed to test a users speed an accuracy in the identification of a randomly generated `tag` amongst similar tag sequences. 

### Program Output
The program generates a random alpha-numeric string of three *upper-case letters* and a numeric variable between *100 - 999*, stitch's them together to form a *base tag* (`base_tag`) then jumbles the tag - retaining the first letter of the sequence to form an  array of unique but similar tags for a user to distinguish between. *Each `base_tag` is unique from one generation (execution of the program) to the next.

### Running The Test Driver
> The project it currently in a experimental phase and therefore is a text-based terminal run application *only*, that can be used either directly through a command line or similar application on Windows, or alternatively through an IDE such as *Visual Studio Code*.

To Use: Download the `.zip` to your prefered location and extract the contents. Open a terminal and locate the file; `cd "C:\User\computer\folder_location..."` then use `python test_driver.py` to envoke the program. A menu will appear and you can follow the prompts for further actions.

> NOTICE: In order to use the program you will need to have Python (or python3) locally installed onto your device. See details at: [Python's Official Website](https://www.python.org//downloads/), for the installation guide.
