# Python Random Sampler
An Experimental Development Project.

### Use Case
> The following program is a **Sequence Recognition Game** developed to test a users speed an accuracy in the identification of a randomly generated 'tag' amongst similar tag sequences. 

### Program Output
> The program generates an alpha-numeric string of three *upper-case letters* and three numeric variables between *100 - 999*, and stitch's them together to form a *base tag* (`base_tag`). This tag is then jumbled, retaining the first letter of the sequence to form an  array of unique but similar tags for a user to distinguish between. *Each `base_tag` is unique from one generation to the next.

### Using The Project
The project it currently a text-based terminal run application that can be used either directly through a command line or similar application on Windows, or alternatively through an IDE.
